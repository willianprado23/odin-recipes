    <p>Moqueca is a traditional Brazilian seafood stew that perfectly captures the country’s coastal spirit. Originating from the states of Bahia and Espírito Santo, it’s typically made with fish or shrimp simmered slowly in a rich broth of coconut milk, tomatoes, onions, garlic, and bell peppers. What makes moqueca special is the use of dendê oil (palm oil) and fresh cilantro, which infuse the dish with vibrant color and a deep, earthy aroma. Each region adds its own touch—Bahian moqueca is heavier and more tropical, while the Capixaba version uses olive oil and annatto for a lighter, more delicate flavor.</p>
    <p>More than just a meal, moqueca is a cultural symbol of Brazil’s diverse heritage. It blends African, Indigenous, and Portuguese culinary influences into one comforting dish often shared among friends and family. Traditionally served bubbling hot in a clay pot and accompanied by rice, farofa (toasted cassava flour), and pirão (a thick fish gravy), moqueca embodies the warmth and generosity of Brazilian cooking. It’s not only delicious—it’s a taste of Brazil’s history and soul in every spoonful.</p>
